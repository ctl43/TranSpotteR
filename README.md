# TranSpotteR
This package aims to identify LINE1 insertion in the genome.

## Procedure
1. Extracting useful reads (extract_read)
2. Clustering reads (clustering_reads)
3. De novo assembly of the reads clusters (sequence_construction)
4. Annotating the constructed reads (annotate_constructed_reads)
5. Inferring the LINE1 integration (line1_inference)
